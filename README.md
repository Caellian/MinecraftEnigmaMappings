# Minecraft Enigma Mappings
These mappings are intended to be used with [Enigma](https://www.cuchazinteractive.com/enigma/) program made by Cuchaz.
In case website is down or you have a problem acquiring Enigma, you can download [my fork](https://github.com/Caellian/Enigma/releases) which has a few more features that I had to add in order to improve functionality.

These mappings are made by me for NOVAL project, you are free to use them without my permission. You can contibute your own mappings if you want to. My goal is to make mappings that are similar to MCP ones so they aren't too hard to use for MCP users, but are also shorter than some MCP ones and hopefully in some cases make more sense.

Goal of this project is to accumulate all mappings for all versions of Minecraft (Ambitious much?!) so any help is welcome.
